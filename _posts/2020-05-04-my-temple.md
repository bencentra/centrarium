I have noticed how the word *“God”* slides out of my mouth after sex. How volcano erupts in my stomach, like an alien, about to appear in the surface of the earth and rip my soul into tiny atoms of thoughts.

“Your body is of God,” a pastor once said. So, I begin to wonder, if God has given my body His power— if God knows that my body is for Him- therefore, he leads me on. I wonder, again, if my body is God— because I notice how hard it feels to pronounce “God”, after sex. How it feels as though I am the owner of my body, not God, therefore, not feeling remorse for every sweat that I break. 

Maybe my body screams God too much at just a thrust during sex, therefore, my mouth goes worn out afterwards. Maybe my body is God, so instead of fighting an earthquake to call him from my mouth after sex, my body comforts me. Maybe God is something or someone up there who really does not even give a fuck as to how I lay or how I got laid. Maybe God is caged between my throat and brain, because I have been conditioned to see sex as an unholy temple— a forbidden garden that must not be walked. 

I have been conditioned to believe that God doesn’t like sex. I freeze to ask myself, “If so, how is the human nature alive?”
