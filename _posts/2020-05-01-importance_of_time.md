Time is an invaluable factor in productivity. 

Today, however, time is relegated in our national life. The *African time* syndrome has crept into all spheres of our lives and most regrettably its now a pest in our tertiary education.

Universities now graduate their students in *'African time'*, students now easily spend five or six years for four years programs without anybody batting an eye-lid.
This is carelessly depleting the strength of our youth because youthfulness is strength and time and youthfulness is ephemeral.
The greatest enemy of youthfulness is wasted time. Time consumes youthfulness like hurricane fire.

Let's stop this careless squandering of our nation's strength through wasted time. Let's stop African timing in our university education because delayed youths are victors in chains.
