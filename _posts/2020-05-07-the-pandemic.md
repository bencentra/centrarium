Unexpectedly,I heard the flame from a break 
Widespread coming out in a bleak,
 Without an invitation visiting souls like it's a relative.

Could it  be Christâ€™s word prevailing, 
when he said he would come at night like a thief?
Not scared of the age,young or old, male or female.

Town, city even nations grabbed with hay
Now everyone's is in awe of the unexpected ugly visitor causing havoc and chaos to us all.

Gotten deep into our path,many attempts to get an antidote proofs abortive.

We're left in dismay to think its our sins hunting us like a prey.
Even we get taunted when we pray.

So,now no soothings to appeal our visitor, instead it keeps fluttering it's wings in the air.
No one to save us except us.
