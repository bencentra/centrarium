Tonight, in the air filled with a subtle feel of harmattan, I wonder how, swiftly, my friendships with people fade. How, just in a very small space of time, we stop to talk to ourselves. How, although difficult, very simple it would seem- just like nothing- no connection- ever happened.

I sat very close to my thoughts tonight. I saw how much I tried to fill the space, despite how much it demanded. I saw how much I beat myself so hard to say “Hello. You crossed my thoughts. I just wanted to check on you.” I am very much withdrawn, and you need an extra effort to pull me in. And, I guess that is where the problem all starts off.

I am very much in depth with the people with whom I could reach at just a snap. People with whom I could talk- with whom I could escape out of my reality.

It is not that I do not like to check on people. It is just that, most times, I fear to not be answered. I fear that everyone is just in your comment section, smiling, laughing, trying to heal with you. But, the moment you approach their inboxes, it is discouraging. Sending you off totally.

I have learnt that friendships should not expect- so that is why when someone was talking to me about some friends who only called when they needed him, but never called to check out on him every other day, I said, “Maybe it is because I really do not care. Or, probably because I do not expect. I give out calls, if I feel to. I call them, mostly, so I do not see what you and others see.”

Kunle is a friend of mine from PEFTI. And, something fondly happens to me when people cross my mind- they end up showing up in different ways.

Kunle crossed my mind 2 nights ago. It was some minutes to 11:00pm. I felt, inside of me, that it would be very inconsiderate to throw out a call. So, I made a mental note to call him the next morning- which, unsurprisingly slipped out over the night, till his message came in the next afternoon.

I wonder why so much friendships do not work out for me. Maybe because I was locking in. Or, probably because it is very hard to vibe with other people.
